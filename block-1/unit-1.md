## Software failure problems
Read [this paper](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5502861&isnumber=5502833&tag=1).
14 cases where softwares contributed to accidents, some of which includes the loss of human life. This is alarming since software usage increases in our daily life.

### Lesson learned
- Testing for the bad is as important as testing for the good.
- Small changes can sometimes have big consequences.
- Always have a backup, even though a reduntant system may not be an appropriate measure.
- Make user aware.
- Correct errors and deploy solutions as soon as possible.
- Success during simulations does not imply success during operations.
- Never pick user convenience over software safety.
- Software may be used in ways it has not been tested for.
- Define system boundaries.
- To be secure systems must be deterministic: test for normal and abnormal conditions.
- Alert the user when the system is using sample data.
- Engineers developing a safety-critical system must have a comprehensive understanding of the overall project.
