## Software failure problems
Read [this paper](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5502861&isnumber=5502833&tag=1).
14 cases where softwares contributed to accidents, some of which includes the loss of human life. This is alarming since software usage increases in our daily life.

### Lesson learned
- Testing for the bad is as important as testing for the good.
- Small changes can sometimes have big consequences.
- Always have a backup, even though a reduntant system may not be an appropriate measure.
- Make user aware.
- Correct errors and deploy solutions as soon as possible.
- Success during simulations does not imply success during operations.
- Never pick user convenience over software safety.
- Software may be used in ways it has not been tested for.
- Define system boundaries.
- To be secure systems must be deterministic: test for normal and abnormal conditions.
- Alert the user when the system is using sample data.
- Engineers developing a safety-critical system must have a comprehensive understanding of the overall project.

## Requirements
1970 Noriaki Kano, for Konica developed the Kano model.
- Basic requirements: expected and so unspoken.
- Performance: features that the customer would be happy to have.
- Excitement features: delight the customer and ofter discovered after some time of use.
With time excitement features become performance once and performance become basics.
Customer will point out only performance features, the only spoken ones.

### 11 foundamental truths
- Requirements are not about written requirements. Requirements are about identifying the actual need.
- Deliver a solution which provides the best payback at the best price.
- You need to understand the requirements in order to build a software. 60% of errors with software originate from ignoring requirements.
- Software must start with a problem, not with a perceived solution.
- Requirements should be written only when needed. Write requirements adds an extra cost also for mainteinance. Sometimes it is required to have written requirements.
