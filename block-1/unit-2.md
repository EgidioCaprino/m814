## Modelling organizations
A context diagram could model an organization and its environment. An organization can interact with its environment in a proactively and reactively manners.

A project: the work for providing an agreed service to the customer.

Vision or mission: what the organization does and what its purpose is.

Stackholders: whose who are interested in an organization.

Measurement: indicates the extent to which the organization is reaching its goals. Be aware of reductionism.

## Inside organizations
*Business processes*: sequence of activities the organization undertake in order to achieve its objectives.
*Business rules*: rules that constraint aspects of the business processes.
*Data flow diagram*: example [here](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=1363986&section=1.2).

### Business processes
The data flow diagram does not show any *detail*.
Most of the activities on the diagram can actually be decomposed into *sub-activities*.
Adding details to a diagram is often *counterproductive*.

### Management theories
*Taylorism*: find the *best practices*, document it, decompose into smaller steps, match the job with the worker.
Often critizied because *views workers as machines*.
Alternatives are more holistic approaches, like *eXtreme Programming*.

### Software and workflow
Since *1980s*, *groupware* allows collaborative work. Instead *workflow systems* aim at loosely cooperating individuals, reinforcing taylorism. These are less amenable to *change*.

## New and evolving systems
What may drive changes within an organization is:
- *external demand*: laws and regulations
- *external opportunities*: new technology
- *external problems*: after a merge or acquisition
- *interal opportunities*: opportunity to enance the internal process
- *internal problems*: software system is unusable
*Change charter*: defines the scope of the change.

### Business process re-engineering
Changes are usually *much larger*. Taylorized workflow as been *discarded* in favour of processes mediated by internet software.
*Legacy systems* are preserved because time, cost or ability to keep on functioning.
