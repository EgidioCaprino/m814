A context diagram could model an organization and its environment. An organization can interact with its environment in a proactively and reactively manners.

A project: the work for providing an agreed service to the customer.

Vision or mission: what the organization does and what its purpose is.

Stackholders: whose who are interested in an organization.

Measurement: indicates the extent to which the organization is reaching its goals. Be aware of reductionism.

## Inside organizations
*Business processes*: sequence of activities the organization undertake in order to achieve its objectives.
*Business rules*: rules that constraint aspects of the business processes.
*Data flow diagram*: example [here](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=1363986&section=1.2).

### Business processes
The data flow diagram does not show any *detail*.
Most of the activities on the diagram can actually be decomposed into *sub-activities*.
Adding details to a diagram is often *counterproductive*.
