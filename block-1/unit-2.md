## Modelling organizations
A context diagram could model an organization and its environment. An organization can interact with its environment in a proactively and reactively manners.

A project: the work for providing an agreed service to the customer.

Vision or mission: what the organization does and what its purpose is.

Stackholders: whose who are interested in an organization.

Measurement: indicates the extent to which the organization is reaching its goals. Be aware of reductionism.

## Inside organizations
*Business processes*: sequence of activities the organization undertake in order to achieve its objectives.
*Business rules*: rules that constraint aspects of the business processes.
*Data flow diagram*: example [here](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=1363986&section=1.2).

### Business processes
The data flow diagram does not show any *detail*.
Most of the activities on the diagram can actually be decomposed into *sub-activities*.
Adding details to a diagram is often *counterproductive*.

### Management theories
*Taylorism*: find the *best practices*, document it, decompose into smaller steps, match the job with the worker.
Often critizied because *views workers as machines*.
Alternatives are more holistic approaches, like *eXtreme Programming*.

### Software and workflow
Since *1980s*, *groupware* allows collaborative work. Instead *workflow systems* aim at loosely cooperating individuals, reinforcing taylorism. These are less amenable to *change*.

## New and evolving systems
What may drive changes within an organization is:
- *external demand*: laws and regulations
- *external opportunities*: new technology
- *external problems*: after a merge or acquisition
- *interal opportunities*: opportunity to enance the internal process
- *internal problems*: software system is unusable
*Change charter*: defines the scope of the change.

### Business process re-engineering
Changes are usually *much larger*. Taylorized workflow as been *discarded* in favour of processes mediated by internet software.
*Legacy systems* are preserved because time, cost or ability to keep on functioning.

## Return on investment
*Costs*:
- *direct*: different methods to establish them,
- *indirect*: management, office space and *oppurtunity costs*.
*Benefits*:
- *tangible*: saving with automation,
- *intangible*: joining the information society which enables internet sales.

### Investment in computers and software
*NPfIT* failed because:
- did not understand the needs of the end users,
- social and cultural aspects were not being considered,
- timetables ignored financial constraints and conflicting priorities,
- no feasibility study nor economica analysis.

*Feasability study*: different actions are considered. For each action predict the *ROI* and include a *post-implementation audit*.
On monetary analysis should take into account interest rates, inflation and opportunity costs. Use *net present value* also known as discounted cash flow.
Profits may occurr after long time and sometime is not even estimable (intangible goods).
Investments are also been influenced by *ethical*.

### Investment decisions
Factors involved in the decision:
- reliability of the software,
- trustworthiness of the supplier,
- likelihood the supplier will last,
- *competitive advantage*: distinctiveness in the software.

*Weighted scorecard* and *balanced scorecard* are methods for taking decisions.

## Relationship between software and the organization
A company is composed by a *human subsystem* and a *software subsystem* interacting with the environment.
The interactions could be *tacit*, explict and documented or embedded in the software.

### Representing the organization in the computer
Software are shaped by social factors too, not just companies rationality.

### Software systems as part of the organization
Flight control software is interconnected with other aircraft instruments. Software systems like that are called *embedded*.
Ultimately every software is not separable for the human organization in which it operates, forming a *socio-technical system*.
*Requirement specifications* may hold abstract information about the connection between the software and the company but it is usually unmaintained and changes over time.

## Knoledge management and learning organizations
Each type of knowledge has its own properties and both contribute to the  richness of human knowledge.

### The nature of knowledge
We know why we need a change and this *knowledge* is *tacit*. We need to make these tacit reasons *explicit*. These *explicit reasons* will lead into potential *benefits* which can be make explicit or not. If we can make them explicit we sill might be unable to make them *tangible*. Our knowledge of the benefits can be made explicit enough to be able to measure the benefit.

Company performances and goals can be tacit or explicit. Making implicit knowlege explicit is difficult and subject to interpretation.

### Knowledge creation
*Knowledge creation cycle*: devised to explain the success of Japanese industry.
Knowledge exists in tacit form within people and externalized form within systems and documentation. It moves in cycle between these two stages increasing at every cycle.
Individual tacit knowledge is shared through socialization, coaching and mentoring.
At some point this collected shared knowledge is externalized then passed again to individuals through training programmes.

### Knowledge management
KM is a process through wich organizations generate values from their intellectual and knowledge-based assets, by sharing them among employees, departments and other companies.
It's not a technology-based concept and it's cyclical.

### Institutional memory
A KM system can help preserver tacit knowledge on staff turnover. However not whole tacit knowledge can be captured.

## Change and learning
A company must adapt to the environment changes in order to survive.
*Organizational learning*: a company can learn, intended not solely as learning individuals. The company documents the best practices and then amend that in light of later experience.

### Single-loop learning
Need to change comes from the environment or from errors within the organization. The company has to indentify the actions to take in order to reduce the gap between intended and actual performances. This gap is called *negative feedback*. When the actions taken by the action make the gap wider it takes the name of *positive feedback*. When the actions work for some time but then the situation get stuck again, it is called *trashing*.

### Double loop learning
*Learning to lear*: single-loop learning ensures adherence to procedures while double-loop learning changes the procedures.

## Software enterprise learning
An individual may apply personal workarounds to the system which can include notes and records outside the system.
The management will harmonize these changes into official procedures.
The adaptation may come out from interactions between different individuals.
The company may decide to integrate the changes in the workflow directly into the software.

### Changing part of the system 1
- Tacit knowledge of individual users and mismatch between intended and actual performance of the system.
- Single-loop learning ensures the individual is able to perform the intended operations until the system is not able to support them
- Single-loop feedback cycle breaks in.
- Individuals look for workarounds updating their tacit knowledge.
- Socialization harmonize tacit knowledge.
- In documentation phase people externalize tacit knowledge: double-loop learning.
- Traning will bring externalized knowledge into individuals tacit knowledge.
- New process is in use then single loop learning ensure adherence to the procedures.
- Change the software requires a round of double loop learning with a software development process.

### Changing part of the system 2
The workflow described above is illustrated [here](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=1363986&section=1.8.2).

### Retaining human processes
*Situated action*: instaed of pre-planned response, individuals have to react on the basis of the situation drwaing upon their tacit knowledge.

### Handling change
Difference scenarios, including *null* and *cost-benefit* analysis for 2 or 3 of them.
*Risk assessment*: places in the scenarios where things can go wrong and how to mitigate the risk.
Decision is taken at a level commensurate with the projected scope and impact of the ange following a *change management strategy* and operating a system of *change control boards*.
Changes are applied to different parts in different stage and so are coordinated through a *version management strategy*.
